            Fast and Efficient Transformer-based Method for Bird's Eye View Instance Prediction
        </div>

    <p>
        Accurate object detection and prediction are critical to ensure the safety and efficiency of self-driving architectures.
        Predicting object trajectories and occupancy enables autonomous vehicles to anticipate movements and make decisions with future
        information, increasing their adaptability and reducing the risk of accidents. Current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches often
        isolate the detection, tracking, and prediction stages, which can lead to significant prediction errors due to accumulated inaccuracies
        between stages. Recent advances have improved the feature representation of multi-camera perception systems through
        Bird's-Eye View (BEV) transformations, boosting the development of end-to-end systems capable of predicting environmental elements
        directly from vehicle sensor data. These systems, however, often suffer from high processing times and number of parameters,
        creating challenges for real-world deployment. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel BEV instance prediction
        architecture based on a simplified paradigm that relies only on instance segmentation and flow prediction.
        The proposed system prioritizes speed, aiming at reduced parameter counts and inference times compared to existing
        SOTA architectures, thanks to the incorporation of an efficient transformer-based architecture.
        Furthermore, the implementation of the proposed architecture is optimized for performance improvements in PyTorch version 2.1.
