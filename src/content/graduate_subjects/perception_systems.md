topics:
    - Sensors and sensor fusion
    - Camera geometric model and transformations
    - Neural Networks for perception
    - 3D perception
    - Object tracking
description: "This course introduces students to advanced perception techniques for understanding scenes based on data provided by robot sensors. Both classical and deep learning (DL) approaches using neural networks (NNs) are addressed, primarily from camera data. Theoretical concepts explained are practically validated in the laboratory. The topics covered include: introduction to perception systems, computer vision, NNs for perception, advanced NN architectures and applications, and object tracking. Upon completing the course, students will be able to utilize NNs to solve robotic problems applicable to other relevant engineering domains."
